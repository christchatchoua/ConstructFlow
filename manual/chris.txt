Hi this is my instructions on working with the project made by chris emmanuel

Normally if you can read this it means you are connected to the main branch 

To be up to date with everyone enter the gitbash terminal and type
$git checkout main // to ensure you are in the main branch

$ git pull origin main // to request the latest changes
$ git commit // to be totally up to date
Please everyone one Samira , Othny , Miguel , Armel and Raphy should create a .txt file with their name where they describe their work , I will use mine
to describe my work and give some info 

I created what we call " groups" (auth) , (supervisor) , (worker) these are like grouping a particular function of the mobile app together 
with the screens , if you create a group like (banana) you will need a screen called loginBanana.tsx to login your banana or bananaDashboard.tsx
And a _layout.tsx to design how each screen comes like in my (auth) group 

 import { Stack } from "expo-router";

export default function RootLayout() {
  return (
  <Stack>
    <Stack.Screen name="index" options={{title:"Login",headerShown:false}}  />
    <Stack.Screen name="signup" options={{title:"signup" , headerShown:false}}  />
  </Stack>
  );
};

index screen which is my login screen comes first and signup comes second , headershown false is to not have that strange bar on top
after creating a group you need to go in the main app folder layout file and add it example

import { Stack } from "expo-router";

export default function RootLayout() {
  return (
  <Stack>
    <Stack.Screen name="(auth)" options={{headerShown:false}}/>
    <Stack.Screen name="(supervisor)" options={{headerShown:false}}/>
    <Stack.Screen name="(worker)" options={{headerShown:false}}/>
    <Stack.Screen name="+not-found.tsx" options={{headerShown:false}}/>
  </Stack>
  );
};
the not found screen is if the user types a fake route so let me handle that screen OK 
I will now create a database with either sqlite or asyncstorage with the help of Samira
Remember if your expo or code does not work , it is not the end of the world , we are there to help you
If you can not read this to the end , therefore you can not code 200 lines
